# TODO notes for KaiserRuby transpiler

## Language Implementation

## Examples

- [ ] Should be able to run the [Cellular Rockomata](https://github.com/Rifhutch/cellular-rocktomata)
- [ ] Math module https://gist.github.com/wrenoud/6be6f7509c88a3d8f9867ae782fb768f
- [ ] Primality checker https://www.reddit.com/r/RockstarDevs/comments/92i6sm/primality_checker_in_rockstar/

## Other stuff

- [ ] Add code history to the REPL
- [ ] Make REPL work with multiline input also, not only singular lines
- [ ] Make a demo visitor that evals the code and waits a bit between commands, so it's more music video-ish. Maybe should change the console colors while at it?
